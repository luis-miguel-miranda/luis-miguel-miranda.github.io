Maintaining a blog is something that never attracted me or piqued my interest in the slightest. Quite possibly still doesn't. Technology and experimenting always did though, since I disassembled my first electronic appliance. That experiment brought down the fuse in my house and nearly gave my mother a heart attack, but lets dig through that another time. 

In contrast, like most engineers/architects and others that love to research and experiment on the tech space, I of course always kept detailed notes in a repository that I can return to and reference in the future to others. He he he...  Of course not. I try my best, but from paper Moleskine notepads to actual files in Notepad++, nothing really felt both easy to write and search/maintain.

With my experience with Github Enterprise use since I've introduced it in new projects at work (couple of years back), it is clear it can do more more than being a great source version control system. The version control and collaborative features that make upt its strength in development are quite useful to manage documentation. Usually documentation is a lesser child, and that is prevalent on startups and larger companies alike. 

On enterprise settings where everything must be in a word or pdf document in sharepoint, with revision tags and colors up the wazoo, documenting becomes something one dreads. Since I end up doing a lot of R&D and exploration in my current company, I need to document a lot to handover/document/maintain knowledge as it moves to regular development and ops teams. I needed to change this dead of writing documentation. No silver bullet seems to exist, but I found a way that suits me and my teams better, using github and markdown for everything. Wow, revolutionary right? Not really.

With different utilities like Pandoc I can generate documents based on my companies template with Markdown. Exactly the same documentation i keep on github with our developers and maintain by our architects and developers, which generates a nice pretty document (both Word and PFD)with all the bells and whistles which can be uploaded to Sharepoint like our managers and auditors are used to.

Now you ask wisely, "what does that have to do with starting a blog"?! This is not a blog. This is where I will document my experiments as I would like to share them and keep them, being them in tech or perhaps just a trip. This is a Markdown file I write in VS Code and put on Github. This is me experimenting with Jekyll that generates a full site based on these post files. This is a bunch of experiments
